# Raspberry Pi Sound Machine with Browser Interface

![sound-machine](sound_machine.jpg)

## Background idea of this project

Sometimes there's a very low-frequency noise in my apartment, which I believe is coming from the building's heating system. It's disturbing my sleep, so I now use a sound machine to play relaxing sounds that help drown out the low hum.

Actually, the problem with low-frequency hum is quite widespread: [Noise & Health](https://journals.lww.com/nohe/fulltext/2004/06230/low_frequency_noise_and_annoyance.6.aspx)

## User Guide

Connect Raspberry Pi to a loudspeaker (loudspeaker with aux input).<br>
Copy **rpi_sound_machine** folder to Raspberry Pi and run it.

The Raspberry Pi Sound Machine allows you to play sounds through a web interface (*hostname*:5000).

### Main Interface

The main page is divided into two sections: a list of available sound files and a list of your favorite sounds.

### Playing Sounds

*   **Play a sound**: Click on the name of a sound file in either the "Sound Files" or "Favorites" list to start playing it. The sound will loop continuously.
*   **Play multiple sounds**: You can play multiple sounds at the same time by clicking on additional sound files.

### Favorites

*   **Add to favorites**: To add a sound to your favorites, click the "ü§ç" (white heart) icon next to the file name.
*   **Remove from favorites**: To remove a sound from your favorites, click the "‚ù§Ô∏è" (red heart) icon next to the file name in the "Favorites" list.

### Controls

At the top of the page, you'll find control buttons:

*   **Pause/Resume (‚è∏Ô∏è / ‚ñ∂Ô∏è)**: Click to pause or resume all currently playing sounds.
*   **Stop (‚èπÔ∏è)**: Click to stop all sounds.
*   **Delete (üóëÔ∏è)**: To delete files, check the boxes next to the file names you want to delete, then click this button.

### Timer

A timer at the top of the page (below control buttons) shows how long the currently playing sounds have been active.

### Uploading Sounds

1.  Click the "Choose Files" button under the "Upload Sound Files" section.
2.  Select one or more sound files from your computer.
3.  Click the "Upload" button to add them to the sound machine.

## Development guide

### Install UV

[Install uv on RPI with Snap](https://snapcraft.io/install/astral-uv/raspbian)

[Install uv on PC](https://github.com/christianhansenx/hansen-developer-notes/blob/main/tools-and-apps/uv/README.MD)

### Install "just" on PC

Install **just** according to: [installation of just](https://github.com/christianhansenx/hansen-developer-notes/blob/main/tools-and-apps/just/README.MD)

Too see list of just recipes, execute just without recipe argument: ```just```

If you are on Windows, then run the **just** recipes in Git Bash (download from  [git](https://git-scm.com/))<br>
[Setting up VS code to use Git Bash terminal](https://github.com/christianhansenx/hansen-developer-notes/blob/main/tools-and-apps/vs-code/README.MD#windows---git-bash-terminal)

### Interfacing with Raspberry Pi from PC

Instead of having to SSH into the RPI, then many operations can be applied by using the just recipes in **justfile**.
To get a list of RPI tool commands then just execute ```just``` without arguments and look for recipes where comment begins with **# RPI:**.

Some of the connections to th RPI is using [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) terminal on the RPI. There is no need to install it - it will be done automatic from the tools commands.

When running tmux from tools terminal, it can be stopped by pressing **enter** key.
